Dave Gray youtube tutorial (link below) for Typescript creating a To Do List completed 17/07/2024

Tutorial covers various Typescript syntax for many of the basics: 
Type, interface, functions, classes, interacting with the DOM (addEventListener getElementBy and createElement etc)

Overview: 
CRUD functions (except update) defined in FullList
Class for an item object created with getters and setters in ListItem
ListTemplate creates a class for clearing and rendering the list to the HTML (interesting document.createElement("") as ... code)
main.ts initialised app provides the event listeners and calls relevent functions

Possible enhancement: add an edit button
Possible enhancement: display a counter for the number of items on the list
